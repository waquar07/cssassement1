    <p class="para1">What is CSS?</p>
    <ol class="list">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li><br>
        <li>CSS describes How HTML elements are to be displaced on screen, or in other media.</li><br>
        <li><b><span class="b"> is not neccesary</span><span class="bg">CSS saves a lot of work.</span></b> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li><br>
        <li class="li">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para2">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</p>
    <ul class="view">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elementsl</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="bg"> <b>in this <br> tutorial we will use inline and internal style,</b></span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para4">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand applies a style to one unique clement. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p class="para4">In CSS electors are used to target specific element or range of elements on web page. Once in cleinen has been targeted, a style of set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p class="para4">There is wide range of selectors available Two at the moar commonly od are class and ID. Both are used to turger elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
